One can expect a warm welcome, variety in drink and foods, music some nights, and just an overall relaxing vibe to the place."

            "Dragonfyre is an immersive upscale lounge offering a variety of drinks and food prepared fresh daily. In the basement is a different story. Under the posh furnishings of the upstairs lounge lies the Dragonfyre Arena, home of the Ultimate Dragon Fighting League. Every second and fourth wednesday's are fight nights where members of the UDFL fight it out for prize money while the patrons can bet on individual fights on the card. On non fight nights the downstairs will be treated like a club for patrons to dance and have fun."

We offer our guests a comfy dining and bar area with a variety of dishes, dessert and drinks that are all free of charge. Our main attraction however is what we call the „bathing cove“ where people can float in the bathtubs and spend a chill and relaxing evening in company of other guests and our staff members. We also offer two rooms for rent, if guests desire a more private environment and want to relax away from the open areas of the inn. For our premium services we are offering a paid GPose service to our guests so everyone can take a nice picture of them and their friends home with them. Besides that we have a bard playing for some hours each night who also takes requests from a wide range of different songs. If we made you curious feel free to contact us ingame, on Discord or visit our homepage under https://thefloatingotter.carrd.co/#"

            "A cozy, starlit tavern styled in a Hingan theme. We offer a hand selected menu of dishes and drinks sourced from Hingashi, Gyr Abania, and La Noscea. For entertainment, we have an in-house bard or open stage when our bard is unavailable. We also have an in-house Tarot card reader for those curious of what the stars hold for them. There's plenty of seating and room on the dance floor to help you relax after those stressful days!"

We all made the decision to rebrand into Lunalis, along with completely stripping and redecorating the venue 3 times! And spending lots of money on new furnishing.",

Things can get a bit chaotic sometimes, but we work very hard to be open and welcoming to all walks of life and RP experience levels. We would love to see you grow with us!"

            "Open the first and third Friday of every month! ◈ The Fury's Hallow is a heavy, immersive roleplay venue focused on roll-based combat. Established in November 2022, the venue is set in a lore-abiding environment within the High House districts of Ishgard, framed as a repurposed manor where the basement has been transformed into a duel tavern and respite for weary adventurers who seek to test each other in combat. Whether you wish to step into the arena to challenge an opponent, enjoy a selection of Coerthan fare and drink, or explore the rooms of House Luvese, we look forward to crossing paths within these hallowed walls."

            "O7Nights Bar & Dance is a roleplay club, with a bar setting within the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV. It is owned by player Juzo Mohjahro of the Aether Datacenter and Midgardsormr Server. It stands as one of the many venues which players can socialize and find a nightlife without leaving home. This venue prioritizes on spreading a contagiously positive atmosphere, 'Being o7,' by accepting and educating new but brave role-players, while indulging veterans with authentic and thoughtful interactions. While upfront providing a relaxed bar setting, this venue has many moments that escalate the energy, between octet bard performances by Raevyn Koneko, regular appearances from wildly outgoing bar regulars and Juzo making drinks just right from his Specialty Menu. On nights where players both want to rest their feet, or get them moving, Juzo and his patrons are there, Making Midgardsormr a little More o7.",
            "Anecdote left by Karilan Black of Crossroads Conversations of Gilgamesh: \"SFW Not your average nightclub; Juzo takes connections and party life to a wholesome level with thrills and chills, depending on what drinks are being mixed upstairs. Fit for literally any level of RP, o7 Nights welcomes you the way adventurers welcome each other at the start of any encounter, and you are sure to find company here who will guide you through every step to learn how to RP effectively and comfortably. Share a drink with a new friend, or dance the night away downstairs. Either way, you'll leave with good vibes.\""

Feel free to make use of our open stage, be it playing yourself, or listening to one of the other bards, as well!"

            "Farmer's Attic is a co-op where crafters, gatherers, and customers can meet for casual farmer's market RP and tax-free commerce on Sunday mornings. Each vendor is responsible for bringing their own merchandise and setting their prices — all profits go back to the vendor, with no house fees taken. Low-level crafters and gatherers are welcome and are in fact encouraged to drop by and sell their wares!",
            "While the premise of the venue is commerce, it is a community oriented space that aims to foster camaraderie between disciples of the land and hand. So bring your best farmer's market outfit and get ready to barter at Aether's own locally sourced marketplace."

            "The Apothecafe is, at first glance, what it says right on the tin: an apothecary fused with a cafe. There's plenty of bright, cozy spots to curl up in and enjoy the our offerings, but as with every light, it has its shadows. Given the nature of its owner, the cafe also serves as a safe space/neutral ground for otherworldly creatures and/or lawbreakers to conduct their business (as long as they behave, of course).",
            "We're a roleplay venue welcoming RPers of all experience levels and styles (though we do tend to lean towards the heavier side of things) and our doors are open for RPing even when we're not staffed. So come drop by, pull up a chair, and wile away the hours with a bubbly potion, a warm meal, or perhaps even something more."

As you take an elevator into the void, the building has 3 stories in which you can either dance on the roof, the dance floor, or even from the basement to tune in to the amazing jams of our DJ for the night. It even has a fantastic hidden bar, for the yakuza business person inside you. Did I say Yakuza? Yes I did! This bar is run by none other than the most dangerous criminals in Eorzea and their ring leader is by far the most ferocious, ME!! So, if you want to get a feel for this action and what the Yakuza lifestyle is like, then come on down to Goblin! You don’t want to miss it!"

Shelves line the wall, littered with books from different ages, varying in genres. Throughout your exploration of the small library, small noises can be heard faintly from beneath the floor but the librarians pay no attention to them. Suspiciously, an old window panel lays near the entrance, almost out of place as the librarians can be caught glancing at them every now and then."

From the sights, sounds and smells, relaxation is sure to come to those that seek a moment away from the world to rest and heal or simply regale the owner or friends with tales of exploration and exploits and woes. Owned and lived in by Usynthuv Adlais, any that visit would be greeted by the wayward Sharlayan and offered whatever she can provide that they desire; knowledge, tea, tinctures, wound care, general healing, massage, and anything else that visitors may need. Except food. There is only soup and it is not a good soup. Good for you, but beyond bland."

Then there's Club Phoenix: Inferno, which sits in the basement of Club Phoenix, and features heavier, harder music, mostly metal. We switch between the two clubs week to week, with one week being a Risen week, and the next being an Inferno night, etc. Each club features a fully stocked bar, with great bartenders who will RP with guests and serve drinks, and raised seating that is situated above the dance floor, for those who want to just relax and listen to the great tunes."

The Nexus is only as strong as those people who nurture its strength, its power. We do this every day without realizing it. Spending time with our friends and loved ones, going that extra mile to put a smile on somebody’s face, or even just simply cracking a joke. The Nexus is the connection that has brought people together for generations and will continue to do so for generations to come.",

This sanctuary to those who are looking to nurture its strength and grow that bond between each other to create a closer community, a closer Eorzea. Here in this Abode, friendships will become stronger, relationships will become more stable, and our community will once again show why it is the greatest in all the lands."

At are venue we offer a free bar, a wide variety of music between our Lofi bot, house bot, and house DJ, and we have community specialists always looking to engage with our guests to ensure they have the best social experience and encourage them to escape their comfort zone and interact with another guest. For all intents and purposes, we are a non-profit venue outside of our small-scale gambling options for RP in amounts no greater than 50k. We do NOT do Raffles, Giveaways, or large-scale gambling, as we believe these opportunities detract from social experiences between guests."

The arena regenerates, fighters are healed, and everyone's expecting carnage; bring your best, not what you think is polite. Go wild. Be cringe. Be free.",
            "More specifically, Final Gambit is a laid-back venue for violence enjoyers and those who are tired of limiting their creative writing for sake of appearances. Can your character detonate their arm like a cannon? Go for it! Are they a master of elements? Shock the floor! Narrative hand-waves are built into the place's identity. Don't worry about destroying the arena with too powerful of an explosion - it'll come back! Worried about permanent injuries? Red Potion™ or the services of one of our medics. Just have fun out there. Remember: Too much is never enough!"

Many local delicacies and a large selection of incense also graces our menu. If you're looking for a place to drift away and relax a while (aside from occasional staff hijinks) there's none better."

TMP offers a bar, a mini free-for-use stage lovingly referred to as \"The Dog House\", and tarot readings. TMP encourages everyone to have fun and enjoy all kinds of music."

A Academy and a Guild are under the banner of Lunar. the curriculum consists of activities and lessons that will prepare the students for a life of adventuring, offering practical knowledge on topics such as combat, first-aid and magic, and many more! While the Adventure Guild offers quests from monster hunts to saving cats from trees, Lunar Rose provides adventures for all with the sufficient skills to handle them. Both the teachers and students at Lunar are players roleplaying their characters, as are the staff and members in the Guild. In addition we have characters that work as school staff, for example running security. We have a free company house that serves as the school grounds, and a small for the Guild. But we also often venture out to the vast world of Eorzea too! The school and Guild is accessible for everyone on the Crystal, Aether and Primal Data Center, and we help out New Rpers/Players too!"

Both dancers and fighters can be hired for their time in the back rooms, but otherwise it's free for all roleplay on the floor! Fighters who enter the cage are treated to custom introductions, help from the announcer and winners come home with fabulous mystery prizes. With some IC safety in place for fighters, it's a little less blood and guts here and a bit more professional wrestling in tone!"

            "The Spa A venue for those looking to relax, rejuvenate, and above all, roleplay, Elysian Springs Spa is self-care socialization supreme... All without costing a single gil. All Elysian Springs Spa facilities are free of charge! All we ask in return is that you RP your heart out while visiting, and be sure to read through the Spa Rules. They're important! Baths The Spa's bread and butter -- relax in the steamy caress of our eight bubbling baths, complete with refreshments! Clothing is optional; comfort is compulsory. Sauna Seeking something more steamy? Crank up the cleanse in the closeness of our sauna, its own separate room with steam galore, located to the south-east of the Spa. Sitting Parlor Sometimes, a little calm is all you need. Take five with a friend in the tranquility of our reading room refuge, an ideal spot for quieter conversations in peace, located on the west side of the spa. VIP Services We do have additional VIP services including tarot, massage and lodgings as well as private baths for those seeking a more intimate space. It is important to note, however, that Elysian Springs is not a brothel. We cater to the fantasy with lovely and gracious staff, but are not courtesans and do not sell ERP at the spa."

Once housing a rowdy free company of adventurers summers ago, it now serves as the site of a teahouse and upscale bar serving everything from specialty tea blends, to a wide array of spirits, to light meals and snacks both sweet and savory.",

To stop by when there is a crowd and the place is staffed by player characters, please come during our public event times. If you wish to role-play in the teahouse outside of our event hours, you can assume NPC staff take care of your characters, or you can contact us and we will have a character come assist you if possible"

            "You lucky people! It's time to come down and experience Eorzea's wildest role-play Free Company, filled with the most talented and fun players on Hyperion. Step through the resort palms and come forward into our grand lobby, where sexy casino bunnies and dapper poker studs will lead through our entertainment destination. Downstairs, a stocked bar stands across from the main stage. In the upper levels, enjoy the games and see if you can break the 100 million gil bank in our casino games, ranging from slots machines to Astrologian roulette. Fancy yourself a great minion trainer? Send your beloved pets into our Dominion of Minions arena to square off against fellow guests or dare to attempt the boss-encounters of our staff's own beasts. If you do strike it rich, you'll find one of our bunny girls the perfect place to spend your ill-gotten gil. As we say in Lucky Sevens, \"What happens in the private chambers, stays in the private chambers.\" Finally, end the night with the fabulous Showcase and Revue featuring the Lucky Sevens dancers, taking place in the company theater to the roaring crowd of high rollers. Just be careful whom you cross, where you set your drink and whose hand you follow into what dark corner. Rumor has it that darker, more terrible plots and schemes lurk beneath the glitz and glamour of the marble and gold halls...There is only one way to find out! Head down the Lucky Sevens Casino & Gentlemen's Club--where roleplay is the biggest jackpot!"

The power of your wish commands is evident here at our RP venue. Let the hosts and hostesses sate your desires, bringing you concoctions fashioned together by our local Alchemists. Try a different mix of shisha each time you visit or possibly even find your favorite. If you desire more, look further in to the themed rooms rented out to various businesses and shops, some even transporting you to far away places."

With Ozwin's personal collection of books at your finger tips, feel free to say stay and hang out a while without spending a single gil. A small stage is open for any who feel particularly musical, and the small bakery is kept stocked with food and drink by Alune and Misuzai. From the library on the main floor with its reading nooks, to the dining tables and plethora of seating downstairs, there is room for all to make themselves at home."

Maybe even pregame before hitting the more popular spots that open from 8pm-3am (est). If that sounds idea but you haven't found that ideal spot, then you haven't heard of The Azeyma Tavern. A small humble social space where you can enjoy both outdoor and indoor dining options, listen to the relaxing sounds of our orchestrion or the performances of our bards. Great food and even better drinks, provided you can hold your intake. And a location fit for any possible collaboration events, sitting only a few steps above the public swimming area in the Goblet. If you and your fc/friends/static or whomever needs a place to eat high quality, stat boosting food then look no further. Our menu holds food and drinks to give you the boost you need to get through those extreme trials and savage raids. All that's missing is you. Come through, take a load off, and enjoy all that Azeyma has to offer."

            "Welcome to New Beginnings, so named because of the warmth and growth we seek to foster. With few exceptions, we will be open each third weekend fri-sun starting at 8pm to at least midnight if not 2 am (CST). Whether it's an open dance floor with DJs, a quieter and more chill vibe as we play games like truth or dare, or a private play party in the dungeon available only to discord members, we want you to have a safe place to play and learn about you and your kinks. We are sex positive, kink and LGBT+ friendly, and do not cater to guests under 18. We have a focus on education, both on various bdsm kinks and in the respect of boundaries as Brigid is a pro domme irl. Please, come ask questions in discord if you have them! We want this to be a safe place to rp, to hang out, to learn, and to enjoy yourself. During the week you may also feel free to come rp in the dungeon with your partner. You may also speak with Brigid about private affairs, be that dungeon play or more of a party. Your privacy is important to us, what happens here stays here."
